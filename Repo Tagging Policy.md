# Repo Tagging Policy

The submitted releases/iterations will be identified in your repos by the following tags:

* Zero Velocity: `0.0`
* Release 1: `1.0`
	* Iteration 1: `0.1`
	* Iteration 2: `0.2`
	* Iteration 3: `0.3`
	* Iteration 4: `1.0` (Release 1)
* Release 2: `2.0`
	* Iteration 5: `1.1`
	* Iteration 6: `1.2`
	* Iteration 7: `1.3`
	* Iteration 8: `2.0` (Release 2)


To submit, simply add the relevant tag to the relevant commit. Other tags in your repo will be ignored, and can be used as you see fit.

For example a tweak to the zero velocity stuff after
its release could be tagged `0.0.1`, but **not** `0.1` !
